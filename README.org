* fd-dired
Provide a dired-mode interface for [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]]'s result. Same functionality as
find-dired/find-grep-dired, using fd/rg instead. Depend on find-dired.

Check out [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/working-multiple-files-dired][this]] for functionality and use case of ~find-dired~.
